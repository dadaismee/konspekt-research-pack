In many of the situations in which statisticians would like to find p(w x) , the sum∑ w p(w, x) is computationally intractable so p(x) cannot be calculated. This usually happens when the state space is continuous rather than discrete, so the sum ∑ becomes an integral ∫ over an infinite number of points.» ([Mann и др., 2022, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/SGFQ77UK))

We can do this indirectly by using a measure of inaccuracy. Active inference employs a measure of inaccuracy called variational free energy, labelled F. Because it is a measure of inaccuracy, smaller values are better than larger values. Given a set of candidate distributions q, the best is the one that produces the lowest value of F. Although the lowest possible value of F is given by the true posterior p(w x) , that might not be one of the available distributions q. In that case, the optimal q is the member of the set that yields the lowest value of F from among the available members.» ([Mann и др., 2022, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/SGFQ77UK))

The penalty for failing to explain the data is usually presented as a reward for explaining the data well; it is therefore introduced as the negation of the term we use here, and is called ‘accuracy’. Consequently, variational free energy is defined as the difference between complexity and accuracy. The goal of inference is described as minimizing complexity while maximizing accuracy.

That function, F , is a sum of two kinds of penalty. Action selection is governed in the same way, but with a slightly different cost function called expected free energy and labelled G. The definition of G is closely related to that of F. The interpretation of the two penalty terms changes as the formalism is updated to reflect the fact we are now making measurements over expected future states. Since future states have yet to be observed, the agent must average over them to obtain expected values. The penalties are associated with failing to satisfy preferences and failing to minimize future surprise.» ([Mann и др., 2022, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/SGFQ77UK))
